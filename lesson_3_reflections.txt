When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

What is the difference between Git Pull Vs GitHub pull request ?
Ans >> If you use git pull, you pull the changes from the remote repository into yours.
If you send a pull request(from GitHub) to another repository, you ask their maintainers to pull your 
changes(from GitHub) into theirs (you more or less ask them to issue  a git pull to your GitHub 
repository).(As a side note, if you're new to Git, I'd suggest using git fetch and then git merge
instead of git pull. git pull is effectively git fetch followed by git merge, but doing them 
separately gives you better control over potential conflicts.)


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Fork ----> Copy a repository on github to a your account on Github
Clone ----> copy a repository from Github to your git (local machine)
Branch ----> On the git repository(local machine) create a braanch to work on a new feature without altering the master branch(production code)
